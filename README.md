# Multi-Model-Text-Generator
# 📝 Shakespeare-Inspired Text Generator (LSTM-based)

This project is a deep learning text generator that creates original content inspired by:

- 🎭 **Shakespearean poetry**
- 🎶 **Song lyrics** from the Genius Lyrics dataset
- 📰 **Blog-style prose** from the WikiText dataset

Each style is modeled using an independent **LSTM-based neural network**, trained at the character level to generate text in a similar tone and rhythm.
